# xopr-gline

A companion tool to [xopr](https://github.com/englacial/xopr) for automated grounding point detections from airborne ice penetrating radar data

## Motivation 
Most tidewater glaciers draining the Greenland Ice Sheet are assumed to be grounded at their terminus. This assumption isn't necessarily true as many glaciers can be floating. This package will contain tools and notebooks to automatically identify this transition between grounding and floating (grounding line) using xOPR. 

## Goals

- [ ] create a reproducible dataset of Greenland grounding points
- [ ] calculate uncertainty in grounding points
- [ ] extend grounding point catalog to Antarctica
